### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Project Engineer from Lockheed Martin Space working to learn how to code to improve my job and start coding in my free time as well.
In my free time I like to do some of the following:
<ul>
<li>Running distance for fun</li>
<li>Play videogames</li>
<li>Watch my favorite sports teams</li>
</ul>
